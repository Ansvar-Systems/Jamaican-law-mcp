When the Certificate of Name given in Baptism (Form I or Form J) is delivered to the Registrar of Births and Deaths,\nfees are payable as follows-\n        If not more than twelve months have gone by since the birth was registered-ten cents.\n         If more than twelve months have gone by since the birth was registered-one dollar.\n     When the Registrar still has in his possession the book containing the counterfoil of the original registration he must forth-\nwith enter the baptismal name and the date in the space provided on the counterfoil. If the registration form itself is also still in\nhis possession, the name must be entered on it too. In both cases he should fill up the left-hand section of that part of this certifi-\ncate headed T o r use only by the Registrar of Births and Deaths\".
